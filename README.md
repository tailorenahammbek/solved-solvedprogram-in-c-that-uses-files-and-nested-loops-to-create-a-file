write a program in C++ that uses files and nested loops to create a file from the quiz grades entered by the user, then read the grades from the file and calculates the average quiz grade for a class. Each student takes 4 quizzes. Use a nested loop to write each student’s quizzes to a file. Then read the data from the file in order to display the student’s average score and the class average.
